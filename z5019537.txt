Week1: 
- For this week nothing much has been done but to decide what project we need to do. Our group initially wanted to create our own app which revolves around the idea of
karaoke on the web. Unfortunately, this wasn't possible after we have sent an email to Ali for confirmation and lead us to deciding on picking project two. Because all project is 
webapp based, we agreed on picking django as the framework to use and learn for the rest of the week. That is what i have done for the rest of the week, I found a django tutorial on
youtube created by freecodecamp.com and spent a couple of days watching it just grasp the concept and syntax. 

Week2:
- Met up with group mates on Tuesday in tutorial and discussed on a couple of things: proposal, allocate possible task/roles for each individual.
- For the rest of the week, I spent time researching on how to draw a good software diagram/system module flow. 

Week3:
- For this week, we received feedback on our project proposal where we received some positive feedback as well as tips from our tutor on where and how we could improve the proposal.
- After our feedback, Me and michael agreed on getting down a basic working interface and draw up a wireframe to further improve the frontend down the line

Week4:
- This week, minimum work was done due to assignment for other courses were about to be due. However, I did watch some front end youtube video that can be applied to the project (E.g. F-Patter)

Week 5:
- Michael and I collaborated together to create a basic functional dashboard, where the lecturer could create a class to store their learning outcomes. 
- To do this task, i started by designing an ER Model so that creating a database schema would become much simplier. 
- Wrote up a basic schema for dashboard by editing models.py (django way of creating db schema)

Week6:
- Our team met up in the tutorial where we would need to demonstrate our current progress to our tutor. Unfortunately, our learning-outcome proposal is still under research and according our tutor, that idea was not enough to meet the requirements of our project. Ali's suggested more features to our project however it was beyond our ability to implement those suggested ideas. Due to fustration of the current project, we ask for permission to pivot to another project and as a group we agreed on picking the property rental system.
- It was unfortunate that 2 of our team members dropped the course during this week due to fustrataion of our project, and with fear of  not being able to complete  the project with working features in time (4 week left)
- Immediately change the dashboard feature to fit the context of our new project (property rental system)

Week7:
- Down 2 members, we contacted ali for a consultation about our project change, tip and our disadvantage in number of team members. Ali noted that he discussed the problem with the lecturer and our marks will be scaled (not sure how much). A tip that was noted down was to find a html template within our project field.
- We found template on themeforest, and started to make the transistion from our old html to new html template we obtained.

Week8:
- Our last demo week before presentation, we were able to put up significant amount of work to catch up with the other group.
- Application contains most of the features we implemented booking, property listing, login, register and searching (without filter), working well along with the template

Week9:
- Lots of late nights coding this week since next week was presentation
- We implemeneted filtering, review, pagination and my profile

Week10:
- Demo Week, at this point in time we just touched up on the code and made sure every feature that were required as well as the extras we had time for were implemented.
- With only 2 member, I am happy with the outcome of our product and as a result have further extended my knowledge on computer science, programming and design. 

Week11:
- Report
- The end. :)
