Week 1
- We created out groups and roughly decided on the tech stack we were going to use. We decided our focus for this week would be to learn django on our own.

Week 2
- Our final group member arrived back from his holiday and we decided on which project we were going to work on. We also decided which parts of the proposal we were going to do.
- I was assigned the epics section of the proposal which I completed this week.
- I also explored the research related to our task and found research papers which we will use to implement our learning outcomes evaluation application.
- As a group we also decided on our workflow

Week 3
- We received feedback on our proposal which was quite helpful.
- This week my task is to explore the NLTK library and implement some basic functionality into our Django application
