Week1:
- The main aim this week was to meet my group and decide on a project. I had a look through the 5 project options. To be frank, I did not have much interest in projects 3 and 4, they mainly involved building nice interfaces. I am much more interested in the first 2 projects that involve interesing data analysis and feel that I will learn much more doing this.
- My group seems really good. We discussed creating a Kareoke app which I think will be quite interesting, hopefully we will be allowed to go down this path. If not, as I said earlier I would like to do one of the first 2 projects.
- After meeting with my group for the first time, we have decided that we will be using Django. My aim for this week is to work through some Django tutorials

Week2:
- The project proposal is due at the end of this week so my group needs to narrow down our focus and create the document.
- We have settled on the second project - a learning outcomes analyser. I feel that this is a good choice for us as the project has room for both data analysis and front-end work. We have two group members very interested in doing the data analysis, and two that will work on the front-end/user interface backend.
- I wrote the Background/intro/aim of the proposal. I learn a lot while doing this about the problem domain. Specifically I dodnt realise just how much research and effort goes into this aspect of designing a course. With the number of courses on offer at UNSW I can only imagine how much time this consumes.

Week 3:
- The feedback from our tutor was quite positive. We do need to make our aim more clear still. This has been a challenge as weneed to do more research into data sets that are available/NLP techniques to evaluate what we can realisticaly achieve.
    - Our tutor suggested that we will need the handbook information to provide actionable feedback on learning outcomes.
    - Initially I thought this would involve parsing the handbook - a massive job, however having a closer look at the data we have been provided with, I think we can avoid this. The data has learning outcomes and how they link to assessment tasks. I think it should be quite possible to build an assessment recommender using this data.
- I have spent most of this week reading the NLTK book. This has been quite enlightening and I am excited to start playing with data.
